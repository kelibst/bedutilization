✅ DONE - Removed malaria cell from all ward entry sheets
✅ DONE - Implemented user-manageable ward configuration system (wards_config.json)
   - Users can now add/update wards by editing wards_config.json
   - See WARD_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md for instructions
   - Ward changes automatically reflect in all generated reports

because <24 hour deaths are not being counted, we should include the option for the user to add a calculation to remove it from the total admission at the end 
of every months and for each ward. evaluate this carefully before you implement it.
